Cultivating Growth by Transforming Constraints into Opportunities
</h2>
  <p>
 <b> Challenge: Unveiling Growth Opportunities </b>
  </p>
<br>
<p>
In the wake of pandemic-induced constraints, an entrepreneurship education program based in a
Toronto hospital faces a critical challenge. The absence of a systematic approach to assess program
strengths and areas for improvement hinders its organic growth. Recognizing this, the imperative arises
for this program to establish an inclusive evaluation framework engaging all relevant stakeholders.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Approach: Crafting Growth Strategies</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We undertook the mission to design and implement a systematic evaluation system of this program. The
primary objective is to identify program strengths and areas for improvement comprehensively, paving
the way for targeted strategies that foster the program's sustained development.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Analysis: Stakeholder Collaboration and Insight Gathering</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Leveraging access to program stakeholders, including students, mentors, and directors, our team initiates
a multifaceted approach. Key Informant Interviews are conducted to inform the development of an
inclusive survey, ensuring that the perspectives of all stakeholders are considered. Completed surveys
and data analysis tools such as SPSS and NVivo contribute to a holistic understanding of the program’s
current state.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Recommendation: A Collaborative Approach to Building and Piloting</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
To ensure the effectiveness of the evaluation process, our team collaborates with stakeholders to craft a
comprehensive survey. Key steps include piloting the survey with stakeholders before the official launch,
validating its relevance and clarity. The resulting survey implementation plan outlines the who, what,
when, and how of administering surveys, emphasizing a dynamic approach that allows the program to
reassess and refine the evaluation tool at designated time points.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Conclusion: Charting the Course for the Future</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
In conclusion, our competitive analysis service and user journey service converge to address the
program’s critical need for a systematic program evaluation. By engaging stakeholders, developing a
comprehensive survey, and implementing a dynamic evaluation plan, our team equipped the program
with the tools to not only identify current program strengths and areas for improvement but also to
foster a culture of continuous growth. The foundation is laid for strategic, data-driven decision-making,
ensures a flourishing future for the hospital-based entrepreneurship education program in the realm of
healthcare innovation and commercialization.
