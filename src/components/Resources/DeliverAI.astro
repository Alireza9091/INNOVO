Delivering Safer and Quicker Patient Recovery with AI-Powered Mobility Devices

 <b> Strategic Insight: Crafting a Path to Safer, Shorter Recovery Times </b>
  </p>
<br>
<p>
We partnered with a pioneering client in the development of smart mobility devices with artificial
intelligence for patients undergoing orthopedic or spinal surgery for chronic conditions. Our client's
mission was clear: to enhance patient outcomes through innovative smart mobility devices. Despite
completing initial customer discovery, lingering questions persisted regarding the go-to-market strategy
and regulatory landscape.

Our research revealed that the company had identified an unmet need for faster recovery times,
validated through consultations with clinicians, and was actively developing a prototype. As external
consultants, we played a pivotal role in verifying the health need identified by this startup.

<b>Revolutionizing Patient Care: A Prioritized Roadmap to Success</b>
</p>

<p>
To ensure alignment with our client's priorities, we collaborated in creating a prioritization framework
within the business strategy. Our final recommendations emphasized the continuation of need
identification activities with specific patient populations, fostering early patient buy-in and engagement
before launch. Additionally, we advocated for co-design sessions with clinicians and patients to validate
the use case, ensuring the solution resonates effectively with end-users.
