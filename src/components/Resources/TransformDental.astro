    Transforming Dental Product Strategy for Optimal Market Impact
  </h2>
  <p>
 <b> Client Challenge: From Product to Clinical Application </b>
  </p>
<br>
<p>
Our client approached us with a dental product and a desire to explore clinical applications. The
challenge was not only to understand the clinical viability but also to determine the optimal pricing
strategy to ensure widespread adoption by dental professionals.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Strategic Approach: Collecting Research and Engaging Key Opinion Leaders</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Our team initiated a comprehensive strategy, building a survey to gauge dentists' sentiments about the
product's pricing and the factors influencing their recommendation decisions. While the client initially
sought sales data and business intelligence, our team expanded the scope to include a competitive
analysis and health need validation, providing a holistic understanding of the market landscape and
engaged Key Opinion Leaders in the field.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Recommendations: Scientific Validation and Continuous End-User Engagement</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
After a thorough analysis, our team recommended adjusting the product's pricing strategy. Given the
lack of compelling scientific and clinical evidence at that time, we advised the client to lower the price.
This strategic move aligned with our understanding that both dentists and patients were unlikely to pay
premium prices without robust scientific backing.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Additionally, we emphasized the importance of ongoing engagement with end-users, foreseeing
potential pitfalls if the client neglected to maintain a strong connection with their market. Our
recommendations were aimed at not only immediate success but also the long-term sustainability of the
product in the competitive dental market.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Client Testimonial: Preventing Waste of Time and Resources</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Post-project, the client reached out with positive feedback. They expressed gratitude, stating that the
survey proved immensely helpful, guiding their decisions even after our project concluded. The insights
gained prevented the client from wasting time and resources on ineffective strategies, positioning them
for success in a competitive market.
</p>
<br>
