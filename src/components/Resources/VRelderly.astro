  Client Overview 
  </p>
Our client, a visionary startup specializing in Virtual Reality (VR) technology, aimed to revolutionize the
experience of elderly residents in nursing homes. Their ambitious goal was to develop a VR system
allowing patients to virtually travel to any destination, enhancing nostalgia moments, and potentially
aiding in Alzheimer's care. Having successfully crafted a prototype, the client sought to implement this
groundbreaking technology in nursing homes across Ontario.
